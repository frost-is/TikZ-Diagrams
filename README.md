# TikZ-Diagrams

This repository contains some of the figures that I redrew for my Ph.D. manuscript. They are in TikZ code, and can easily be exported in PDF vector format. I will try to add the PDFs for greater ease of use in the future (i.e. once I'm done with my thesis). The code is also a little dirty. Feel free to propose PRs. If you are using them in some scientific paper, I would be grateful if you could reference my Ph.D. thesis as the source (I will add the bibtex reference it when it gets published)

Thanks !
